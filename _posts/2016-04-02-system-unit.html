<h2>What is System Unit?</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p>
      <b>System unit (system chasis)</b> also known as a computer chasis, tower, cabinet or base unit that contains electronic components.
      The most common personal computers are <b>desktop</b>, <b>laptop</b>, <b>tablet</b>, and <b>mobile device</b>.

<h3>4 most common types:</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h5><b>Desktops</b></h5>
    <p>Desktop system units located in separate case; tower unit (tower computer) has vertical system unit; all-in-one computer combines system unit and monitor.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h5><b>Laptops</b></h5>
    <p>Laptop (notebook) system units contain secondary storage devices. Ultrabooks (ultra-portables, mini notebooks) are lighter, thinner and have longer battery life than other laptops.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h5><b>Tablets</b></h5>
    <p>Tablet system units are located behind the monitor. They are smaller, lighter and generally less powerful than laptops and use a virtual keyboards.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h5><b>Mobile Devices</b></h5>
    <p>Mobile devices (handheld computers) fit comfortably in one hand. Smartphones are most popular type. System units also located behind the display screen (monitor).</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h5><b><q>Components</q></b></h5>
<p>Each type of system unit has the same basic components including <b>system board</b>, <b>microprocessor</b> and <b>memory</b>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>System Board</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p>
      <b>System board</b>, also known as <b>mainboard</b> or <b>motherboard</b>. It controls all communication for the computer system. All external and internal devices and components connect to it.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Sockets</b> provide connection points for chips (silicon chips, semiconductors, integrated circuit). Chips are mounted on chip carriers.</li>
        <li><b>Slots</b> provide connection points specialized card or circuit board.</li>
        <li><b>Bus lines</b> provide pathways to support communication.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">IMG</div>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>Microprocessor</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">IMG</div>
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p>
      In most personal computers, the <b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> or <b>processor</b> is contained on a single chip called the <b>microprocessor</b>. It has two basic components: a <b>Control Unit (CU)</b> and <b>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</b>.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>Memory</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p>
      Memory holds data, instructions and informations.<br />
      There are three type of memory chips:
      <dl>
        <dt>Random Access Memory (RAM)</dt>
        <dd>
          Volatile or temporary memory (storage) because their contents are lost if power is disrupted.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cache memory</b> is a high-speed holding area for frequenly used data and information.</li>
            <li><b>DIMM</b> is used to expand memory.</li>
            <li><b>Virtual memory</b> devides large programs into parts that are read into RAM as needed.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Read-Only Memory (ROM)</dt>
        <dd>Non-volatile memory and control essential system operations.</dd>

        <dt>Flash Memory</dt>
        <dd>Does not lose its contents when power is removed</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">IMG</div>

<h3>Expansion Slots & Cards</h3>
<p>
  Most computers allow users to expland their systems by providing expansion slots on their system boards to accept <b>expansion cards</b>.<br />
  Examples of expansion cards:
  <ul>
    <li>Graphics Cards</li>
    <li>Sound Cards</li>
    <li>Network Adapter Cards/Network Interface Cards (NIC)</li>
    <li>Wireless Network Cards</li>
  </ul>
  Plug and play is the ability for a computer to recognize and configure a device without human interaction.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Bus Lines</h3>
<p>
  <b>Bus lines</b>, also knows as <b>buses</b>, provide data pathways that connect various system components. <b>Bus width</b> is the number of bits that can travel simultaneously.<br />
  <b>System buses</b> connect <b>CPU</b> and <b>memory</b>. <b>Expansion buses</b> connect <b>CPU</b> and <b>slots</b>.
</p>
<h5><b>Expansion Buses</b></h5>
<p>
  Three types of principal expansion buses:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Universal Serial Bus (USB)</b> can connect from one USB device to another or to a common point (hub) and then onto the system board.</li>
    <li><b>Firewire bus</b> is similar to USB bus but more specialized.</li>
    <li><b>PCI Express (PCIe) bus</b> is wildly used. It provides a single dedicated path for each connected device.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Ports</h3>
<p>
  Ports are connecting sockets on the outside of the system unit.<br /><br />
  <b>Standard Ports</b><br />
  Four standard ports are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Video Graphics Adapter (VGA)</b> and <b>Digital Video Interface (DVI)</b> - provide connections to system unit.</li>
    <li><b>Universal Serial Bus (USB)</b> - widely used to connect keyboards, mice, printers and storage devices; one port can connect several devices to system unit.</li>
    <li><b>Firewire</b> - provides high-speed connections to Firewire devices such as camcorders and storage devices.</li>
    <li><b>Ethernet</b> - high-speed networking port that has become a standard for many of today's computers.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Specialized Ports</b><br />
  Five speciality ports are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>External Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (eSATA)</b> - for high-speed connection to large secondary storage devices.</li>
    <li><b>High Definition Multimedia Interfave (HDMI)</b> - for high-definition digital audio and video.</li>
    <li><b>Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)</b> - for digital music.</li>
    <li><b>Mini DisplayPort (MiniDP. mDP)</b> - for large monitors.</li>
    <li><b>Thunderbolt</b> - for high-speed connections to up to seven separate devices connected one to another.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Cables</b> - used to connect external devices to the system unit via ports.
</p>

<h3>Power Supply</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p>
      Power supply convert AC to DC and power desktops.<br />
      AC adapters power laptops and tablets and recharge batteries.
    </p>

<h3>Electronic Representation</h3>
<p>
  Human voice create <b>analog</b> (continuous) signals while computers only recognize <b>digital</b> electronics signal.<br />
  <b>Numeric Representation</b><br />
  Data and instruction can be represented electronically with a two-state or <b>binary system</b> of numbers (0 and 1). Each 0 or 1 is called a <b>bit</b>. Eight bits is equall to a <b>byte</b>. <b>Hexaddecimal system (hex)</b> uses 16 digits to represent binary numbers.<br />
  <b>Character Encoding</b><br />
  <b>Character encoding standards</b> assign unique sequences of bits to each character. Three standards are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange</b>. Historically used for personal computers.</li>
    <li><b>EBCDIC - Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code</b>. Historically used for mainframe computers.</li>
    <li><b>Unicode</b> - 16-bit code, most wildly used standard.</li>
  </ul>
